# Pandas

## Simple Descriptive Statistics

Before taking the big guns, such as aggregations, I usually try to first get a good grasp of the data inside the data frame. Looking at the `head` and `tail` of the data framew is one of the first things you should do:

```python
# check the top of the data frame
df.head()

# check the botto of the data frame
df.tail()
```

If the data frame is very large you can also grab a random sample of it:

```python
# Fetch an exact number of random lines (make sure that freq=None)
df.sample(n=5)

# Fetch a percentage of random lines (make sure that n=None)
df.sample(freq=0.1)
```

Last but not least, you can try `describe` and `value_counts`. `describe` will return a new data frame consisting of various basic stats for each of the numeric columns in the data frame (count, mean, std, min, max, 25%, 50% 75%):

```python
df.describe()

#            price	area
#   count	150.0	150.000000
#   mean	943139.5	100.085800
#   std	    844677.0	44.566817
#   min	    62000.0	26.220000
#   25%	    419875.0	70.740000
#   50%	    585500.0	93.710000
#   75%	    1132500.0	126.697500
#   max	    4500000.0	279.500000
```

`value_counts` gets applied applied to a discrete series instead, and is a really easy way of checking how many rows there of each value there are in a data frame:

```python
df["city"].value_counts()

#   MÃ¼nchen    96
#   Hamburg    24
#   Berlin     16
#   Bremen     14
```
