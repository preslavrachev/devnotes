# Welcome to DevNotes

DevNotes is a constantly updated selection of notes and development recipes I have collected over time. I started writing things down, mainly for my personal reference, but with time, I became convinced that other people would benefit from those as well.

Some of the things here have originated on [my blog](https://preslav.me), or have been reposted there. Feel free to check it out as well.

## Who am I?
<img style="float: right; width: 100px" src="https://preslav.me/images/avatar.jpg">
My name is [Preslav Rachev](https://preslav.me) and I am a genuinely curious individual. I am the epitome of the fullstack software developer, having built systems and applications with a variety of tools and technologies, for about a decade. I work primarily as a JVM/Python double agent, tying distributed data-driven applications together.
