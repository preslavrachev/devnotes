# Welcome to DevNotes

## Where Am I?
DevNotes is a constantly updated selection of notes and development recipes I have collected over time. I started writing things down, mainly for my personal reference, but with time, I became convinced that other people would benefit from those as well.

Some of the things here have originated on [my blog](https://preslav.me), or have been reposted there. Feel free to check it out as well.
